    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>
      Just got back on here to take a look at one of the starting points in my
      journey to becoming a computer programmer. There has been lots breaks in
      my learning process. I hope to make sure that does not happen for the next
      365 days from today, November 1, 2020. Even if I have only thirty (30)
      minutes to commit to this endeavor, I will do my very best to ensure that
      I do not miss a day of learning to code for the next 365 days. I hope I am
      able to keep myself accountable for the whole duration.
