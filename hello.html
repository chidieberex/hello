    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>
      Just got back on here to take a look at one of the starting points in my
      journey to becoming a computer programmer. There has been lots breaks in
      my learning process. I hope to make sure that does not happen for the next
      365 days from today, November 1, 2020. Even if I have only thirty (30)
      minutes to commit to this endeavor, I will do my very best to ensure that
      I do not miss a day of learning to code for the next 365 days. I hope I am
      able to keep myself accountable for the whole duration.
    </p>

      Today is November 2, 2020. I could not work on any Python coding lessons.
      I did however work on some R programming for my Data Scientist ambition. I
      watched a couple of YouTube videos on R programming for Data Scientists. I
      hope to do some more of that tomorrow. I will try to continue to update my
      programming journey on this space. I also created my Stack Overflow
      account today.
